 ## "Credit/Loan Approval Prediction




 
Project Overview:


Objective:

The primary objective of this project is to leverage decision tree-based models for predicting credit approval. The project aims to develop robust algorithms capable of assessing loan eligibility based on a set of features typically found in credit applications. By employing a comprehensive workflow, including data cleaning, feature engineering, and the implementation of various tree-based models, the project strives to provide accurate and interpretable predictions to aid financial institutions in making informed decisions.

Dataset:

The dataset used for this project contains information relevant to credit applications, encompassing both categorical and numerical features. Features such as income, employment status, credit history, and other pertinent variables serve as the basis for training and evaluating the predictive models.
